Level 4
Awesome, you found a Nexkon weapon augment to replace your police issue one. It looks like it has some pretty advanced features. Just what are they manufacturing in this place? Let's start with the basics: aim with the mouse and fire with left click. Your laser sight has limited range, so distant enemies will be harder to hit. There is only one guard in the next room, take him out to advance!
